This package includes scripts and code for assembling scaffolds using Bowtie and Bambus. 

Bowtie is used to align the original reads to the contigs. Bambus is used for scaffolding.

The package has been tested with AMOS v3.0.1. Previous versions will definitely not work. 
Later versions may work. The code is available under src. To build the code run the script
build.sh. This will build the code in directory bin.

Detailed use instructions:
1. Bowtie is used to align the original reads to the contigs. 
2. The Bambus 2 pipeline is run using the goBambus2 script
   - This pipeline generates the final output and fasta sequences for the scaffolds and contigs files.
   - Bambus 2 does not recall consensus so if two unitigs overlap, only of their sequences will be represented in the overlapping region. 

The main script (assembleScaffolds.sh) has the following parameters:
1: The working directory.
2: the prefix for your input/output (so it assumes there will be a PREFIX.libSizes, etc)
3: The location of the orginal fastq files to map to the contig. These are assumed to have a .1.fastq and a .2.fastq and the file name is what determines the library name to compute pairing. For non-mapping assemblies, this specifies whether you want to use unitigs or contigs (0 means unitigs, 1 means contigs).
4: The suffix for the file you want to use for the mapping. So utg.fasta means it will look for the file named PREFIX.utg.fasta to map the reads to.
